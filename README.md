# Market_Regime_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
The objective of this project is to predict future market regime shifts (e.g., upward, downward using a Directional Change (DC) framework, where the target variable is defined as:

1. 1 (Buy): Predicted upward regime.
2. 0 (Sell): Predicted downward regime.

Key Adjustments for DC Framework; Event Definition:
1. DC Upward Event: Short-term price movement ≥ threshold (e.g., Δ% from trough to peak).
2. DC Downward Event: Short-term price movement ≤ threshold (e.g., Δ% from peak to trough).
