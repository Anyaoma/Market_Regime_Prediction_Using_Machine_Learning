# Market_Regime_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
*This project is influenced by the work of Lucas Inglese on market Regime prediction. This project however, differs in terms of data size and the adoption & testing of several models and feature engineering techniques.

The objective of this project is to predict future market regime shifts (e.g., upward, downward using a Directional Change (DC) framework, where the target variable is defined as:

1. 1 (Buy): Predicted upward regime.
2. 0 (Sell): Predicted downward regime.

Key Adjustments for DC Framework; Event Definition:
1. DC Upward Event: Short-term price movement ≥ threshold (e.g., Δ% from trough to peak).
2. DC Downward Event: Short-term price movement ≤ threshold (e.g., Δ% from peak to trough).

The selection of data used in this analysis include; EUR_USD, GBP_USD, USD_JPY (2015 - 2023). The EUR_USD data was first analysed to get an insight into what the data was like.

Feature Engineering: lagged log returns and lagged rolling autocorrelation values in the farthest past showed higher autocorelation with the response variable than the lagged variables in the recent past, hence there was a shift from [1,5,10...] to [20, 40, 60....] spaced lags to avoid multicollinearity. 
* Still the correlation matrix of the engineered features depicts multicollinearity among the volatility, and RSI features.

To reduce the issue of multicollinearity and retain more predictive individual variable, the PCA was applied to the volatility and RSI variable sets, thus resulting in singularised predictors:

The above activities reduced the predictor set and produced a defined predictor space:

To obtain a robust model, the three asset EUR_USD, GBP_USD and USD_JPY was combined to generate a larger data size. Below is the correlation matrix across the assets. The log close and kama_(moving_average) predictors dont seem to have much predictive power on the EUR_USD data, but possesses stronger correlation on the GBP_USD and the USD_JPY set.

The Linear Regression, Adaboost and Random Forest produced slightly better result after a cross validation was performed. However, the Random forest classifier was chosen to be tuned because of interactions within the predictors that can be handled by boosting and bagging algorithms as opposed to the linear regression.

Using the f1 metric. The Random forex classifier produced the following results as the best parameters:
Best: 0.728939 using {'criterion': 'entropy', 'max_depth': 5, 'n_estimators': 20}

The unseen test set was analysed and predicted. It produced a 72% score using the f1 metric

According to the randomforest algorithm, the rank of feature importance is given by;

In conclusion:
The prediction of a market regime is half the puzzle solved. Additional indicators can be used alongside the signal generated by this model to enter trades.
